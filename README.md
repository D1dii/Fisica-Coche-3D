## Main objective
In order to win the game, you have to complete 1 lap passing throught all the checkpoints. When completed, a little piece of music will sound indicating that you have won.
PD: Due to different performance in different PC, the bounce pad may push the player very high or not high enough. We cannot solve that, if in your PC there is a problem for reaching the next platform, we are very
sorry.
